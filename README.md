Exported components can be seen [here](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/ecommerce)

If you would like to import(clone) the project to take it for a test run make sure you have [bit installed](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/getting-started/installing-bit).

```bash
npm i -g @teambit/bvm
bvm install
```

Then you can use the `bit import` command to import all components into your workspace.

```bash
bit import "learn-bit-react.ecommerce/*"
```

Start the dev server

```bash
bit start
````

You should now see all the ecommerce components on http://localhost:3000/
